    LOAD_CONST "hello" DUP
    ; bug occured when there is anything on the same line as a string constant; the last element of the line would be ignored
    ; cause: There was nothing at the end of the loop that adds the final token if it is not blank and not in the string vector, in the splitExceptQuotes function
    LOAD_CONST ", world"
    CONCAT
    CALL println 1
